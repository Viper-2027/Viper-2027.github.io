<H1>Dogs</H1>

<p>I have two dogs, Daisy and Anja, both eight years old. They live with my parents back in New York City and when they are lucky, they run around at our house in CT.


<H2>&hearts; &nbsp; Daisy &nbsp; &hearts; </H2>

<p>Daisy is technically my dog. She's a Chinese Crested Powder Puff, black and white with a bit of gray, and she's tiny. She on any given day, weighs up to 10 pounds and is extra fluffy. I took her to training classes when she was a puppy but she can be quite naughty. Every time I go home from college she sits on me so I can't go back to school. </p>

<H2>&hearts; &nbsp; Anja &nbsp; &hearts; </H2>

<p>Anja is technically my older brother Jack's dog, but Daisy and Anja live together. I was the one who took Anja to her training courses. She's quite naughty when running in the woods so we may be re-training her. She is more shy than Daisy but since I left for college, she has become more energetic. At any time she weighs between 25 and 30 pounds but Daisy is the boss.

<H1>Horse</H1>

<H2>&hearts; &nbsp; Pi &nbsp; &hearts; </H2>

<p> Pi is my dad's horse, he's over twenty years old and is beautiful. He is also the sweetest horse I have ever met. I'm convinced he is a dog trapped in a horse's body! He loves bananas above all else and always knows I have a treat for him. He listens to me even if he gets grumpy about it. I have ridden him before and while he doesn't spook, every time he flicks a fly his entire body moves which can be scary. He is 17 hands tall and weighs approximately 1800 pounds, more than ten times my body weight. </p>

<H1>Sports</H1>

<H2>Fencing</H2>

<p>I've been fencing for the past two years and have competed at the college level in both √©p√©e (last semester) and foil (this semester). I was on. my high school club team and, when it became varsity, was one of the highest scores. College fencing tournaments are a different format, with both team competitions (like high school), individual competitions, and mixed competitions. That has been the biggest adjustment to being a college fencer. This week I will be fence saber and √©p√©e while I normally fence foil. There are three weapons in fencing, each with their own rules.

<ul>
<li> Foil
<li> √âp√©e
<li> Saber
</ul>

The targes for foil are:
<ol>
<li> Neck
<li> Torso
</ol>

The targes for √©p√©e are:
<ol>
<li> Face
<li> Upper body
<li> Lower body
<li> Feet
</ol>

The targes for saber are:
<ol>
<li> Upper body
<li> Top of the head
</ol>

The gear required for each weapon are

<H2>Artistic Swimming</H2>

<p> Artistic swimming is the new name for artistic swimming and "combines technical perfection, synchronization, choreography, artistry, and expressive power" as defined by the Olympics. At Mount Holyoke College we have a club called Lyonfish Artistic Swimming, open to any who wish to join! I am the captain and coach of the team and also do all the choreography. This semester at the showcase, we are going to do two songs as a full group, "Glory" by Friday Pilots Club and "Achilles Come Down" by Gang of Youths.

<H2>Squash</H2>

<p>I have played squash for five years, all four years of high school, and my first year of college. It is the sport I am best at despite the fact I've done other sports for longer. I practice up to 9.5 hours a week and did boot camp this past summer. I recommend the squash classes and am always around to teach! Squash is my passion and I want to share it with the world. </p>
